## General info
This project is developed entirely by Liam Price in order to pass the VET IT SAT. The overall function of this software is to act as a Control Panel for my Exploration Robot. The actual Arduino code that runs on the Robot is contained in another Repo here:

### 2021 UPDATE:
#### So this project ended up winning the VCE Top Designs for VET Integrated Technologies! It is currently on display in the Melbourne Museum, you can view it here in a virtual tour: https://museumsvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/learning/top-designs-2021/
#### And here is a little article they posted about it: https://museumsvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/learning/top-designs-2021/vce-vet-programs/integrated-technologies/
#### And lastly here is an embarrassing interview they posted of me where I say 'umm' more than anything else: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty_FZUM7rPA

Here is a YouTube video with a basic demonstration of the system: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TiRYpMsIOc&t=27s)
