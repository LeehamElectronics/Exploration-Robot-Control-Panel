# IoT Exploration Robot: Control Panel
## School Assessed Task: VET Integrated Technologies
#### ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Note:
##### Whilst working on this project I will commit all changes through PyCharm in order to keep track of my work and for authenticity purposes.
##### I will also create releases at certain stages which you can download in the releases page. I will only ever create releases when the program is in a working condition and I will only do this when major changes have been made.
